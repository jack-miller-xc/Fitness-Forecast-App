Fitness Forecast is native iOS application that lets users know the ideal times to run/bike/hike/cornhorn/etc each day based on weather conditions. Each time has a 'patended' WeatherFit score that represents the favorability of weather conditions at a specific point in time. Since each athlete experiences the weather diffently, Fitness Forecast also allows for further personalization of the score using a 'stoplight' system. Users can easily cycle through the available options (green, yellow, red) by simply tapping a metric's row. Green metrics mildly affect the score, yellow metrics moderately affect the score, and red metrics strongly affect the score. Users can also completely disable a metric from the WeatherFit score by cycling through to the gray option. 

Below is a typical example.

Don't mind a little rain during your workout? 
Set the rain amount to green.

High UV a concern on rides?
Toggle it to yellow.

High humidity always kicks your butt on long runs? 
Set it to red.

Love when it rains on your runs? Keep that score high.

Along with the score, Fitness Forecast's graph screen is a great way to track weather trends for up to 3 days in advance. See how weather is trending to see how a workout in a few days is looking and save as many locations as you want! Fitness Forecast hopefully is an awesome tool for anyone looking to improve their workouts or their experience outside. Especially with the summer heat upon us!
